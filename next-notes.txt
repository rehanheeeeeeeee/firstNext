Next js helps in server side rendering of react components 

And whatever components are created within the pages folder
will have a  route created for them by next 

But for the index.js file it doesnt create a route with its name 
but instead of that it links that component to home route of the web app.

For 404.js the component inside of it is going to rendered whenever 
a user tries to access a route which does not exist.

By using the next js our react components are rendered through the server
before itself which means they are not rendered as the user accesses them in there 
browser but are rendered before hand itself.

So if we want to make API request we wanna make it when the component 
is rendered by the server itself which is before the user accesses them

So this will help the data being rendered before hand itself in the 
component rather than the API call being made when the user accesses the
component.

Which kinda reduces the user expierence as the component will be empty
for afew seconds 

And this is was useEffect does it makes API calls when the component
by the browser for making API calls within the component in the server
we have to use a function in next

Dynamic Routes:

Now in our case we wanna create a dynamic route or a wildcard 

like /noobs/:noodid

here in this route the noobid can be anything 

we can put anything inside noobid and the component will be rendered.

In order to do such a thing we would need to create a file with its name
in brackets and what this is going to do is tell next js that the component
inside of here can be rendered when ever they try to access anything
like in our case it can be noob/1 , noob/fnwbfjksjbf , /noob/332u
anything then also this specific component will be rendered.
